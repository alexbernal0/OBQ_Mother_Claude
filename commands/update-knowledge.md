description: Review and refresh project knowledge files — MEMORY.md, lessons.md, backtest log, and strategy parameters
---

Perform an OBQ knowledge refresh:

1. Read `knowledge/backtest_results_log.md` — are there any recent runs not yet logged?
2. Read `tasks/lessons.md` — are there patterns that should be promoted to MEMORY.md?
3. Read MEMORY.md via auto-memory system — is it current? Any stale entries?
4. Check `knowledge/strategy_parameters.md` — does it reflect current PARAMS dicts in pwb_strategies/?
5. Suggest any SuperMemory saves via /super-save for breakthrough findings
6. Provide a summary of knowledge health: "Knowledge is [current/stale]. [N] lessons pending review. [N] results logged."
